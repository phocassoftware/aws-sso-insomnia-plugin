# Guidelines

PRs are welcome!

Commits are linted using the [Angular commit conventions](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c). This enables the use of [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

The three main types of commit message to understand are:

1. `fix` - a bugfix which you can think of corresponding to a patch number increase in semver
2. `perf` - a performance improvement which you can think of as corresponding to a minor number increase in semver
3. `feat` - a brand new feature which you can think of as corresponding to a major number increase in semver

An example commit message would be:

```markdown
feat: added unicorns
Sprinkled unicorns throughout the package for a better user experience
```

With a well formatted commit message, you will be able to commit your changes. A commit format not matching the conventions will result in an error.
